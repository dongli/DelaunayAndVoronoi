Description:

  This is an implementation of Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagram on the
  sphere. The purpose of this re-implementation is for considering the efficient
  update when all the data points can move without construct  from  the scratch.
  It originates from the need of space tessellation in my numerical scheme (TTS)
  for solving linear advection problem.

Current Development:

  - Only sphere manifold is considered (for atmospheric modelling).
  - Delaunay triangulation and its dual Voronoi diagram are finished.

Directory structure:

  The program is made up by several modules in "Core" and "Util". In "UnitTest",
  there are some tests can be run. A script in "NCLScripts" can be used to show
  the output graphically.
