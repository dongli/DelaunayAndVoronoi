Description:

  This is  an implementation of Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagram.  The 
purpose  of  this re-implementation is for considering the efficient update when
all the data points can move without construct  from  the scratch. It originates
from the need  of space  tessellation  in my  numerical scheme (TTS) for solving
linear advection problem.

Current Development:

  - Only sphere manifold is considered (for atmospheric modelling).
  - Basic Delaunay triangulation has almost been finished.
