Description:

  This is an implementation of Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagram on the
  sphere. The purpose of this re-implementation is for considering the efficient
  update when all the data points can move without construct  from  the scratch.
  It originates from the need of space tessellation in my numerical scheme (TTS)
  for solving linear advection problem.

  All the codes are written in Fortran 95/2003. High degree of modularization is
  realized. The internal data structure is completely hidden from users.
________________________________________________________________________________
Directory structure:

  The program is made up by several modules in "Core" and "Util". In "UnitTest",
  there are some tests can be run. The scripts in "PlotTool" can be used to show
  the output graphically.
________________________________________________________________________________
Dependencies:

  The NetCDF library is needed for outputing results, and NCL is incorporated in
  visualization.
________________________________________________________________________________
Usage:

  DelaunayAndVoronoi is highly modularized. The use of it is very easy.
  In some Fortran program:

      ...
      use SampleManager
      use DelaunayAndVoronoi
      ...
      call SampleManager_Init(<number of samples>)
      call SampleManager_Set(<sample lon>, <sample lat>)
      call DelaunayAndVoronoi_LinkSample
      call ConstructDelaunayTriangulation
      call ExtractVoronoiDiagram
      call DelaunayAndVoronoi_Output(<file name>)

  The program has been compiled using "ifort" and "gfortran", you can change
  the compiler in "Makefile.basic" for FC macro.

  To visualize the results, use the scripts in "PlotTool":

      cd <directory where results are>
      <relative path to "PlotTool">/PlotDTVD.sh

  And following some questions, it will generate PDF file(s) of the Delaunay
  triangulation and Voronoi diagram projected on the sphere.

Current Development:

Finished:
  - Only sphere manifold is considered (for atmospheric modelling).
  - Delaunay triangulation and its dual Voronoi diagram are finished.

To be finished:
  - Optimize the resulting Voronoi diagram to avoid short edges.
  - Incoporate some efficient update methods to avoid intensive reconstruction.
